Indecisive Eater is all about loving food but hating to make decisions! When you first get to the page, make an account providing your street address. From there if you go to the decide for me section it will bring up a random restaurant. Click roll again to find another restaurant. Apply any specific filters you want on the right hand side. On the local restaurants tab, you are able to see a list of local restaurants, and you can favorite them. The favorites tab has an option to pick a random restaurant from your favorites. 


## getting started
From this directory in the command line you must run npm i to install all of the dependecies! From there go to your config directory. Make a new file called config.json . Follow config.json.default as a guide for how to set up your file. After your done create a .env file (make sure it's in the root of server directory). Follow .env.default as a guide. The API_KEY required here must be a valid google-places api key!
